# Workshop - Building Intelligent Apps 
This Hands-on workshop is designed for AI Engineers, Developers, Solution Architects and who are eager to learn how to harness the power of Azure OpenAI and build next gen intelligent apps.
The following sessions will be covered:

1. [**Setup and prepare Evironment:**](/Student/Challenge-00.md) Necessary setup for the hands-on activities. This includes setting up an Azure subscription, accessing Azure OpenAI services, and installing the required development tools. This initial session is crucial to ensure that all participants are well-prepared and can fully engage with the workshop's content.
1. [**Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure OpenAI:**](/Student/Challenge-01.md) Dive into the world of RAG and learn how to enhance your AI applications by integrating Azure OpenAIâ€™s capabilities. This session will guide you through the process of implementing RAG with Azure AI Search, enabling your applications to leverage external data sources for more grounded and contextually relevant responses.
1. [**Build intelligent applications with Semantic Kernel (C# or Python):**](/Student/Challenge-02.md) Unlock the potential of Semantic Kernel in developing intelligent applications. Whether you prefer C# or Python, this session will provide you with the knowledge to incorporate Semantic Kernel into your applications, facilitating seamless integration of AI prompts with conventional programming languages for smarter, more responsive applications.
1. [**Build a QnA copilot with prompt flow in Azure AI Studio (Optional):**](/Student/Challenge-03.md) Discover how to create a responsive QnA system using prompt flow, allowing for intuitive and efficient user interactions with your AI solutions.

This workshop requires 4-6 hours to finish depending on the attendees' skill level. It is a collaborative activity where attendees form teams of 3-5 people to go through every workshop.

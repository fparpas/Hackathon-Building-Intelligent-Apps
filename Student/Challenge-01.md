# Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure OpenAI

 [< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction
This hands-on session will guide you through the process of integrating your own data with a large language model to create a powerful and responsive chat application.

## Description
You’ll start by creating a project in Azure AI Studio, where you’ll explore the chat playground to interact with AI models and customize chat interactions. Next, you’ll set up the environment and deploy an enterprise-grade chat web app, integrating it with Azure OpenAI for intelligent responses. Finally, you’ll dive into .NET Core development, creating a simple application and adding intelligence using Azure OpenAI.

You should complete the following steps in the reference guides:

- [Create a project and use the chat playground in Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/quickstarts/get-started-playground)
  - Create an Azure AI Studio project.
  - Deploy an Azure OpenAI model.
  - Chat in the playground without your data.
- [Deploy an Enterprise Chat web app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/deploy-chat-web-app)
  - Deploy and test a chat model without your data
  - Add your data
  - Test the model with your data
  - Deploy your web app  
- [Create .NET core application and build your first intelligent app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart?pivots=programming-language-csharp&tabs=command-line%2Cpython-new#create-a-new-net-core-application)

## Success Criteria

- Demonstate that you can chat with your own data in AI Studio Chat Playground
- Deploy the web app and demonstate that you can chat on your own data in the deployed app
- Demonstate that you can chat with your own data in a .NET Console application
